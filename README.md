Robust Model Loading and Quantization Strategies for Efficient Clinical LLM Inference: Engineering Lessons from the CURE-Bench Pipeline

<h1 align="center">ABSTRACT</h1>

<p>Deploying large language models (LLMs) for clinical decision support requires careful balancing of fidelity, resource consumption, and reproducibility. This paper reports engineering lessons from CURE-Bench, an end-to-end evaluation pipeline that emphasizes robust model loading, prioritized quantized inference, and telemetry-driven diagnostics to enable efficient clinical LLM inference on constrained hardware.

We present a multi-strategy loading framework that first attempts format-aware fast loaders (e.g., Unsloth), then low-bit quantized backends (BitsAndBytes 4-bit/8-bit), and finally standard Transformer loading with CPU offload when necessary. Between attempts the system performs deterministic memory reclamation (torch.cuda.empty_cache(), gc.collect()) and records detailed logs of exceptions, peak memory, and timing. These engineering controls dramatically reduce unrecoverable failures and allow 9B-parameter class models to run on 16 GB GPUs in practice.

Using curated clinical question datasets and development runs limited to 100 samples, CURE-Bench evaluates four heterogeneous checkpoints (Gemma-2 9B quantized, LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral-7B, and a Qwen-style distilled checkpoint). We instrument per-sample telemetry  input/output token counts, reasoning trace lengths, model initialization times, and correctness flags and aggregate these into a multi-panel dashboard that juxtaposes accuracy, token efficiency, generalization gap, and loader success flags. Key empirical findings include: (1) Unsloth plus BitsAndBytes quantization enabled stable model initialization with GPU memory footprints of approximately 5–6 GB, avoiding OOMs during evaluation; (2) validation accuracies varied substantially (10%–40%), with the best performing quantized model achieving 40% while some larger or more verbose models performed worse; (3) higher token verbosity did not correlate with improved accuracy  the model producing the longest reasoning traces yielded the worst selection accuracy, indicating wasted token cost; and (4) computed test-validation gaps were not interpretable in this run because the holdout test split lacked labeled answers, highlighting the need for labeled holdouts to measure generalization.

We analyze why quantization succeeds operationally but can fail to preserve task fidelity: layer-sensitive quantization, tokenizer mismatches, and task-domain misalignment are primary contributors to degraded accuracy. We demonstrate practical mitigations layer-aware mixed precision, warm-up generations for tokenizer validation, and quantization-aware fine-tuning (e.g., QLoRA style)  and provide reproducible scripts to automate these checks. The work situates these engineering practices within current literature on efficient LLM inference for healthcare, including mixed-precision strategies, edge profiling, and sustainability considerations. Moreover, CURE-Bench explicitly records provenance (submission packages and serialized JSON logs) to support reproducibility and regulatory traceability.

CURE-Bench’s contribution is pragmatic: it codifies a reproducible, telemetry-first approach for deploying quantized clinical LLMs, combining loader fallbacks, deterministic cleanup, and comprehensive dashboards to make tradeoffs transparent for engineers and clinicians.

Our results indicate that carefully applied 4-bit quantization together with format-aware loading can enable large clinical models on modest hardware with acceptable operational risk, but that model selection and domain alignment remain decisive for task fidelity. We conclude by recommending best practices for clinical inference: (a) prefer format-aware fast loaders and quantized backends where validated, (b) perform quantization-aware validation and fine-tuning per task, (c) constrain reasoning verbosity to maintain token economy, and (d) include labeled holdouts to assess generalization. Practically, adopting CURE-Bench in clinical model evaluation pipelines supports compliance and regulatory review by preserving run artifacts and provenance (submission packages, serialized logs, and dashboards).

Hospitals and research teams can use these outputs to perform post-hoc audits, ensure reproducible deployments, and guide model selection under real-world constraints, thereby accelerating safe translation of LLMs into clinical workflows effectively.</p>

Figure 1. CUREBench dashboard
Multi-panel dashboard that aggregates key telemetry and evaluation metrics produced by the CURE-Bench pipeline. Typical panels include: (top-left) per-model validation vs test accuracy bar chart (y-axis: accuracy %; x-axis: model identifiers), (top-center) per-model peak memory and time-to-initialize (y-axis: GB or seconds; x-axis: model), (top-right) loader/strategy success flags (categorical ticks or colored markers showing which strategy — Unsloth, BitsAndBytes, Transformers — succeeded), and (bottom rows) distribution plots: question-type breakdowns (counts per type), token-efficiency scatter (avg tokens vs accuracy), and reasoning-length histograms (characters/tokens). Exact layout can vary (3×3 grid or similar) but the dashboard purpose is an integrated operational snapshot.

This dashboard is an audit-first visualization: it highlights which models initialized successfully (and by which strategy), how much hardware each model consumed, how much token budget models used per question, and where accuracy/efficiency tradeoffs lie. Operationally, it shows that Unsloth + 4-bit quantization consistently reduced peak memory and enabled larger checkpoints to run; it flags models that are memory- or token-inefficient, and surfaces dataset problems (e.g., unlabeled test split) via the accuracy panel.

A scatter plot where each point represents a model. X-axis: average token usage per sample (input+output tokens or output tokens depending on the script). Y-axis: overall accuracy (commonly the average of validation and test columns, or validation when test is unlabeled). Points are annotated with model names. igure 2 highlights the token-cost vs correctness tradeoff. From the run: Gemma-2 shows moderate tokens (~650) with the highest validation accuracy (≈40%); Mistral produced the longest outputs (~766 tokens) but the worst accuracy (≈10%). This demonstrates that longer, verbose chains-of-reasoning do not necessarily improve task accuracy, and may impose large throughput and energy costs for little return. For deployment, prefer models offering reasonable accuracy with lower token budgets.

Figure 3. Generalization Gap Analysis
A bar chart where each bar corresponds to a model and the bar height equals test_accuracy − validation_accuracy (percentage points). Positive values indicate better performance on the holdout test than on validation (rare); negative values indicate worse test performance. In this run the measured gaps are strongly negative for all models because test_accuracy is effectively zero (the test split lacked labels); thus the bars signal dataset labeling issues rather than model overfitting. The primary operational takeaway is diagnostic: the gap panel is invaluable to detect labeling or dataset-preparation problems that would otherwise be missed. In a properly labeled experiment, a small gap suggests good generalization; a large negative gap suggests overfitting or distribution shift.

This typically breaks down into input vs output tokens stacked or a single bar representing the total.Figure 4 quantifies resource consumption per query. In your run, averages clustered in the 600–770 range. Models with higher averages (Mistral) impose higher cost, wall-time, and energy per prediction. This is actionable: to reduce inference cost, decrease decoding lengths, apply token halting strategies, or prefer models with concise reasoning. It also informs batching capacity and throughput planning for deployment.

  <h1>Conclusion, Summary, Research Gaps & Contribution to Knowledge</h1>
  
The CUREBench pipeline evaluation demonstrates that strategic model loading and quantization can robustly support clinical LLM inference. Using Unsloth to apply fast, low-level patches and BitsAndBytes 4-bit quantization allowed all models to load with only ~6 GB of GPU memory, enabling inference on 9B-scale models in a 16 GB GPU environment. The result was a high-throughput evaluation framework that systematically measured both accuracy and efficiency. Our key insights are: (1) Model loading strategies (Unsloth vs. standard Transformers) worked reliably – Unsloth accelerated initialization without compromising correctness – and 4-bit quantization cut memory by roughly 75% [19], permitting larger models to run. (2) Accuracy vs. efficiency trade-offs: The Gemma2-9B model achieved the highest clinical reasoning accuracy (40%) with moderate token use, whereas more verbose models (like Mistral-7B) incurred heavy computational cost for poor accuracy. This suggests that, for clinical tasks, optimal performance requires both sufficient model capacity and output conciseness, echoing findings that output length should be managed to balance throughput and correctness [42]. (3) Generalization performance was effectively zero on the unlabeled test set, indicating that models did not transfer their (validation) performance to unseen data under our metrics. This highlights an inherent limitation in current benchmarking (no test labels) and underscores known challenges of domain generalization in LLMs [4]. Overall, the evaluation confirms that 4-bit quantization and intelligent loading make clinical LLMs more efficient and robust in practice. CUREBench’s integrated dashboard and summary metrics provide a comprehensive view – combining hardware utilization, latency (via token counts), and task accuracy – that affirms the pipeline’s effectiveness for clinical inference.
Research Gaps and Contribution to Knowledge
  
Several open questions and limitations emerged from this evaluation. First, the lack of labeled test answers meant we could not truly assess generalization. Future work should incorporate fully annotated holdout sets to quantify out-of-domain performance (addressing a gap noted in clinical LLM benchmarking [4]). Second, our tasks were limited to multiple-choice and short-answer reasoning. Generalization to free-text clinical tasks (summarization, note completion) or multimodal data remains untested, which is important given diverse clinical use cases [42]. Third, while 4-bit quantization proved effective overall, its impact on nuanced medical reasoning is not fully understood. Prior studies show minimal impact on accuracy [19], but it is possible that subtle clinical reasoning tasks are more sensitive to quantization noise. Evaluating this will require specialized metrics (e.g. chain-of-thought correctness) beyond aggregate accuracy. Fourth, we measured token counts as a proxy for compute, but did not directly measure inference latency or energy use; incorporating real-time profiling would strengthen efficiency analyses.
  
CUREBench’s contributions lie in addressing some of these gaps through novel engineering and evaluation practices. By providing an end-to-end reproducible pipeline with detailed dashboard visualizations (Figures 1–4), CUREBench enables a more holistic assessment than accuracy alone. In particular, computing and plotting metrics like “Average Tokens per Response” and “Generalization Gap” alongside accuracy offers deeper insights into model behavior. This approach builds on prior benchmarks but extends them by focusing on inference efficiency and stability, which are often underreported in LLM evaluations. Additionally, CUREBench demonstrates that integrating recent tools (Unsloth, BitsAndBytes quantization) can significantly enhance medical LLM deployment feasibility; sharing this workflow fills a practical knowledge gap for the community. In sum, while many questions remain about LLM robustness and domain adaptation [4][42], our work advances the state of practice by combining systematic benchmarking with engineering optimizations tailored to clinical use. The findings and tools from CUREBench can guide future clinical LLM development, highlighting that careful quantization and model selection are as critical as model architecture for reliable, efficient medical AI.
